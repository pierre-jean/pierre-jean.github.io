My name is Pierre-Jean Baraud, I'm an engineer in Computer Sciences. I'm passionate about open-source and code. I like to share and discuss with my hacker friends about new trends in web technologies, OS and hardware.


I currently live in Paris, and I'm planning to settle in Hamburg, Germany.

If you want to contact me, don't hesitate to [mail me](mailto:pierre-jean@baraud.fr)
