<div class="entry-content"><p>It all started with simple instruction: <code>-t</code> <em>flag assigns a pseudo-tty or terminal inside the new container</em>&hellip; And a few seconds of puzzling thoughts. <em>What is exactly a pseudo TTY?</em> <em>What does it mean to attach or detach a process from it?</em></p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/linux/gnome-terminal.png"></p>

<p>Beware my friend, cause this article will lead you into the depths of forgotten history and guide you through the arcane of the kernel mechanism, but light of knowledge should shine upon you at the end of this journey.</p>

<h2>The origin of the myth: the Teletype</h2>

<p>When you act as Neo from Matrix by popping up a fancy green terminal to impress your friends around (what do you mean, <em>&ldquo;nobody does that&rdquo;</em>?), you are actually playing with the legacy of a very old device, that surely not much of you have even seen in your life: the Teletype.</p>

<h2>A legendary object</h2>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/linux/teletype-model-28.jpg"></p>

<p>Do you see this beauty in the picture? That&rsquo;s a Teletype. A <em>model 28</em> by <em>Teletype Corporation</em> to be precise. And precise should I not be, as there are countless of models, built by many different forgotten companies. The history of Teletype finds its roots in some first experimentations during the late 19th century, but truly began in the 20s and finds an end in the 70s, when Fax began to be good enough to replace them.</p>

<p>A teletype is basically a machine that sends the letters you typed on the keyboard through electric signal to another machine or network, and prints (literally prints, on a paper!) letters received through the reception cable. Obviously, the different models evolved with time to offer more features and performances:</p>

<ul>
<li>Usage of <em>Multiplex signal</em>, in order to allow the usage of one physical cable to send and receive messages</li>
<li>Support of <em>punched card</em> to send prepared messages at full speed without the need of typing them</li>
<li>Usage of video screen (you&rsquo;re welcome, trees!)</li>
<li>Increase of speed (from 50 baud to 150000 baud)</li>
</ul>


<p>This type of machine was at the time the best way to transmit data in a reliable and fast way.</p>

<h2>Stop your boring oldish gibberish&hellip; Why the heck are you telling me about this?</h2>

<p>Because instead of building new devices to interact with computers, pragmatic people at the time decided to reuse existing Teletypes to connect to them.
Hear me well, I&rsquo;m not talking here about the <em>Personal Computer</em> (PC) you are familiar with, I&rsquo;m talking about a big massive machine in its own dedicated room where you had no access if you were not cool enough, and where you had to send commands from the teletype and read the output printed back.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/linux/mainframe2.jpg"></p>

<p>Actually, one terminal was directly connected to the machine within the same room : <em>the console</em>. Man, I can&rsquo;t tell you about the hype on being the lucky one behind the console. Well, I can&rsquo;t because I&rsquo;m not that old, but I&rsquo;m sure that should have been a big thing back then.</p>

<p>Anyway, you must now realize a few things: it would be nice for instance when using a terminal to see what you are typing. So what about asking the computer to echo back to the terminal what it received, so that it is printed? And what about erasing with backspace what have been typed? Yep, the OS should take care of that for us, we only use a dummy Teletype after all.</p>

<h2>Under the hood</h2>

<p>Here is a diagram of how a Teletype was interacting with a computer:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/linux/teletype-mainframe-workflow.png"></p>

<ol>
<li>Each machine is (conceptually or physically) connected to two cables: one to send instruction to the computer and one to receive output from the computer.</li>
<li>These cables are connected to the computer through a serial cable plugged into an Universal Asynchronous Receiver and Transmitter (<em>UART</em>) that transform the asynchronous flow of data into bytes words.</li>
<li>The computer has an UART driver to read for the hardware device.</li>
<li>The sequence of characters is passed to the line discipline. The line discipline will be in charge of converting special characters (like <em>end of line</em>, <em>backspaces</em>), and echoing (reprinting) what has been received back to the teletype, so that the user can visual what he/she types.</li>
<li>The flow of instruction is passed to the TTY driver, that pass them to the <em>foreground</em> processes for the <em>session</em> associated with this TTY. Indeed, as a user, you can execute several processes in parallel, but only interact with one at a time, letting the others working (or waiting) in the background.</li>
</ol>


<p>The whole stack define below is called a TTY device, and several ones can exist at the same time for a computer. So different line disciplines can be set for different devices, each TTY having its own foreground job, etc.</p>

<h2>From the Teletype to the Terminal</h2>

<p>Besides unpredictable haircuts and memorable rythms, the 80s has also brought us what they called <em>intelligent terminals</em>. Slowly, terminals evolved to badass devices, with screen, memory, and even small processors to manage specific features on their side.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/linux/terminal_vt100.jpg"></p>

<p>They started to <em>look like</em> your current PC desktop. Beware, though, they are in no way comparable! They are still dummy objects, despite their name. They do not compute things on their own: managing fancy colors and having a fast refresh frequency is far from being even close to a computer. It&rsquo;s the 80s after all, it&rsquo;s hard to call anything smart from that period of History.</p>

<p>These devices worked the same way as Teletype, but also introduced some new special features that had to be supported by the software to be enabled (colors,special movements, etc).</p>

<h2>Wake up Neo, it is all virtual</h2>

<p>The massive set of wardrobes that used to constitute a computer gradually turns down to a nice little box that you could fit under your desk. And there was no more dozens of terminal connected to it, but only one monitor and one keyboard. Nevertheless, your current Linux machine keeps emulating several (usually 7 by default) terminals connected to your hardware. But to protect you from the effort of getting up and physically going to another chair, the OS allows you to switch from one terminal to another by a simple press of keys (<code>Ctrl</code>+<code>Alt</code>+<code>F1</code> to <code>Ctrl</code>+<code>Alt</code>+<code>F7</code>). This feature is called <em>virtual terminals</em>, and is represented by the files <code>/dev/tty1</code> to <code>/dev/tty7</code>. You can see any of this file as a duplex cable connected to a terminal. If you write to it, you send the information to be print to the terminal, if you read from it, you receive what is typed from the terminal (try it, it works).</p>

<p>When you switch from one virtual terminal to another, the OS detach your <em>seat</em> (a set of input and output devices like monitor, keyboard, mouse, etc. representing the interactive interface with the user) from the virtual terminal, preventing this one to write on the hardware devices, but letting the running processes to read and write to the files (that will buffer the information until you reattach your seat to this terminal), making the switch between sessions transparent for running jobs.</p>

<h2>I know no master</h2>

<p>But I imagine only a few of you are actually using the virtual tty just mentioned. You are usually using a terminal console application launched from a graphic environment that is itself launched from a virtual terminal (yep, breathe and read again).</p>

<p>So when you launch your favorite terminal emulator like <em>xterm</em> or <em>gnome-terminal</em>, how do the processes know where to write the output, and where to get the input from?</p>

<p>Basically, when you launch a terminal within a graphic environment like this, it will spawn its own equivalent of /dev/ttyX: the terminal emulator will open a special file located in <code>/dev/ptmx</code>, called the <em>master side</em> of the <em>pts</em>, will do some magic with <code>ioctl</code> function, which will create a <em>slave side</em> of the pts in <code>/dev/pts/X</code>.</p>

<p>The processes running in the session will be attached to this file, that will behave like any file from the virtual terminal, except that there is no attachment to a seat: you can open several terminal emulator windows at the same time and display them side by side, having different session running.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>We could dig the topic further, speaking about the function <code>ioctl</code>, detailing how the kernel handle the session, expressing our endless admiration for the great 70s look of the <a href="http://terminals.classiccmp.org/wiki/images/f/fb/DEC_VT05_121708587772-2.jpg">DEC VT05</a> terminal&hellip;
