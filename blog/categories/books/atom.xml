<p>Today I am gonna give you a quick review of the last two books I read: <a href="http://www.informit.com/store/clean-coder-a-code-of-conduct-for-professional-programmers-9780137081073">The Clean Coder</a>, by <em>Robert C. Martin</em> (aka <em>Uncle Bob</em>), and <a href="http://www.informit.com/store/software-craftsman-professionalism-pragmatism-pride-9780134052502">The Software Craftsman</a>, by <em>Sandro Mancuso</em>.
Both books cover the same topic: the <strong>Software Craftsmanship</strong> movement.</p>

<h2>The Software What ?</h2>

<p>Remember my <a href="http://pierre-jean.baraud.fr/blog/2013/08/10/be-passionate/">first blog post about passion</a> ? Well, if I had to rewrite it today I would title it &ldquo;Be passionate, be a Software Craftsman&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Yes, Software Craftsmanship is all about passion. But it is also much more than that, and taught me a lot about my own weaknesses.</p>

<h3>Passion</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;m gonna be lazy and shamelessly quote Sandro&rsquo;s book:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>Passion. That summarizes it all. Software craftsmen are passionate about software development and their profession. They are passionate about solving problems with simple solutions. They are passionate about learning, teaching and sharing. Software craftsmen are passionate about helping the software industry to evolve; sharing their code; mentoring young developers; sharing their experiences via blogs, books, talks, videos, and conversations; and being active in technical communities.</p><footer><strong>Sandro Mancuso</strong> <cite>The Software Craftsman</cite></footer></blockquote></p>

<p>Yes, I know, he just expressed above the exact content of my first blog post, but in a clearer and more efficient way&hellip; thank you for pointing that out! But even if I cannot compete with Sandro&rsquo;s writing style, at least we are on the same page regarding the importance of passion!</p>

<h3>Professionalism</h3>

<p>But Software Craftsmanship is also about <em>professionalism</em>, as clearly demonstrated by the subtitle of the first book <em>&ldquo;A Code of Conduct for Professional Programmers&rdquo;</em>, and of the second one <em>&ldquo;Professionalism, Pragmatism, Pride&rdquo;</em>. If the message was not clear enough, you will find a reference to professionalism in every paragraph, if not sentence.</p>

<p>And this is where my previous vision fell short, and the first big lesson I learnt. Before reading these books, I figured the business world and true passion as natural opposites. I suggested to embrace your hobby and to not care about this corporate guys in suits that would crash your dream trying to make you do &ldquo;just a job&rdquo;. In a word: I was childish.
I was thinking that success will come if you were motivated enough, and that only startup companies promoting cool-t-shirt-dress-code had understood the future of our industry. I was blaming everyone except me for things that may not go well in failing projects, companies or culture environment.</p>

<p>I was acting as the opposite of a Software Craftsman, as this movement is all about taking responsibility, involvement in the project and in the company you are working for, and spreading the culture of passion with new technical disciplines.</p>

<h3>Disciplines and Values</h3>

<p>Speaking about disciplines: you may expect this book to teach you a set of disciplines to apply in order to succeed in any situation. And even if it does mention a set of practices (like <em>Test Driven Development</em>, <em>Pair programming</em> or <em>SOLID principles</em>), these books are <em>not</em> about these disciplines. These books are about <em>values</em>. It&rsquo;s a long term vision on our industry, the mistakes made, and how some current disciplines and attitudes can solve these common issues.</p>

<h3>And many other things</h3>

<p>You want to know more? Good. Go read the books. Now.
Robert Cecil Martin and Sandro Mancuso are great writers and you will have real pleasure reading them.
If you still need convincing, you can watch one of the public presentations the authors gave (for instance <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OhXqBlCmrM">here</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Xy3QC7yxJw">there</a>) covering in some ways the same topic as the books. The value of these books is not so much about the topic they cover but how they illustrate each idea through different examples that speak to each one of us.</p>

<h2>Why are these books so important?</h2>

<p>You may ask: do you need to go through the hundreds of pages of these books to figure out such an obvious message as &ldquo;be passionate and professional&rdquo; ?
Well, I&rsquo;m afraid the reality demonstrates every day that this is not that obvious.</p>

<h3>A simple fact</h3>

<p>Have you ever been slow down in your projects by software evolutions that were waiting to be delivered? Have you ever been appalled by the numbers of broken features each time a software is released?<br/>
And as a developer, have you ever feel mistrust for a business industry that does not understood you?</p>

<p>Chances are that yes, you have. The sickness of the software industry cannot be more visible than it is now and the truth is our society has no clear idea on how to fix it. Millions are waisted by companies because of this situation. And that&rsquo;s the intention of the Software Craftsmanship to provide a way out.</p>

<h3>A necessary bridge</h3>

<p>A cultural gap exists between business managers and software developers. Business see developers as a working line, a technical pipe without much value except providing the expected result. By expected result, I mean the one specified by business managers and software architects, the ones creating value through specifications. That&rsquo;s why in many companies, the only career evolution available is to switch from the <em>technical position</em> of developer to a <em>management position</em> such as business manager, architect, and so on. This illustrates the poor consideration management usually have upon developers. On the other hand, a big distrust exists in software departments towards the management, the clients, and basically anyone that is not a developer. We confine ourselves behind technical considerations that appear out of reach for the common people.</p>

<p>This split of values also affects the developers profession. Many are divided between choosing over their career (promoting: business, management, architecture, specific-technologies) or over their passion (coding, open-source, choosing new technologies, sharing). Software Craftsmanship is a way to do both. Software craftsmen don&rsquo;t see their activity as a production working line. They see it as a craft. They know that companies who tried to outsource their software department to low-skilled unknown coders failed. Specifications and upstream architectural decisions are not enough. Software craftsmen bring value to companies. They offer the flexibility needed by companies to follow the business evolution. And this requires high skilled developers, passionated and proud by the result they provide.</p>

<h3>A day to day transformation</h3>

<p>Who owns your career? Software craftsmanship offers you a chance to take back control on your working environment, on your career and on your passion.</p>

<p>These books will give you a pragmatic approach to change your habits and enhance your working conditions. For instance, by changing the language you use, you will know how to identify the lack of accountability expressed in your daily discussions. You will learn how to take responsibility and communicate it to your colleagues.</p>

<p>You will learn how to face pressure without affecting your discipline. You will get insights on how to work efficiently with the different characters and singularities you can meet in your team.</p>

<p>Each concept of the book can be applied starting today in your current job. The value they will bring will be immediate and visible. Chances are you will find yourself much more happier doing the same job with the same persons.</p>

<h2>Food for the mind</h2>

<p>Whatever book you read from the above, they will certainly achieve the same result: open new perspectives, provide a big shot of motivation and reconcile yourself with many situations you would have defined as problematic before.</p>

<p>During your reading, you will learn on how to raise yourself to the level of software craftsman without sacrificing your ethic and your personal life.
But these books may also leave you with a strange feeling. They may open doors without you noticing. By questioning your work life you will also challenge your definition of happiness, your goals in life and maybe even rediscover your own identity &hellip; It is of course not the purpose of Software Craftsmanship books to answer such philosophical questions, but be prepared to face them.</p>
