Software Craftsmanship: two books reviews
=========================================

Today I am gonna give you a quick review of the last two books I read: [The clean coder][clean-coder], by _Robert C. Martin_, and [The Software Craftsman][software-craftsman], by _Sandro Mancuso_.
Both this book cover the same topic: **the Software Craftsmanship movement**.

The Craftsmawhat ?
------------------

Remember my [first blog post about Passion][first-blog-post] ? Well, what I was trying to express in a naive way back then could be restate today as "Be passionate, be a software craftsman". 

But The Software Craftsmanship is much more than that.

### Professionalism

### Discipline

So which one is the best?
-------------------------

### The common part

### The differences


Conclusion
