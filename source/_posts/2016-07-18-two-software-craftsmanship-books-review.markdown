Today I am gonna give you a quick review of the last two books I read: [The clean coder][clean-coder], by _Robert C. Martin_, and [The Software Craftsman][software-craftsman], by _Sandro Mancuso_.
Both books cover the same topic: the **Software Craftsmanship** movement.

The Craftsmawhat ?
------------------

Remember my [first blog post about Passion][first-blog-post] ? Well, what I was trying to express in a naive way back then could be restate today as "Be passionate, be a software craftsman". 

But The Software Craftsmanship is much more than that, and taught me a lot about my own weaknesses.

### Professionalism

The Software Craftsmanship is about _Professionalism_: the subtile of the first book is _"A Code of Conduct for **Professional** Programmers"_, and the second one is _"**Professionalism**, Pragmatism, Pride"_. If the message was not clear enough, you will have a reference to professionalism every paragraph, if not sentence.

And this is where my vision (partially presented in my first article) fell short, and the first big lesson I learnt. Before reading these books, I was _opposing_ the business world and the true passion. I was in a way suggesting to embrace your hobby and not to care about this corporate guys in suits that would crash your dream trying to make you do "just a job". In a word: I was childish.

I was thinking that success will come if you were motivated enough, and that only startup companies promoting cool tee-shirts dress-code had understood the future of our industry. I was blaming everyone except me for things that may not go well in failing projects, companies or culture environment. I was acting as the opposite of a Software Craftsman, as this movement is all about taking responsability, involvement in the project and the company you are working for, and spreading the culture of passion with new technical disciplines.

### Disciplines and Values

Speaking about disciplines: you may expect this book to provide you with a cookbook of disciplines to apply in order to succeed in any situation. And even if it does mention a set of practices (like _Test Driven Environment_, _Pair programming_, _SOLID_ principles), these books are _not_ about these disciplines. These books are about values. It's a long term vision about our industry, the mistakes made, and how some current discplines and attitudes can solve these common issues. It is not about having a fanboy attitude for such technology or methodology, but only for the _value_ they bring. When I told you they are spoiling all the fun...

### Tell me more

I won't summarize here the content of the books, as there are already many articles on the Software Craftsmanship movement, and many talks available online from the authors (for instance [here][sandro-talk] and [there][uncle-bob-talk]) covering more or less the same topic. Moreover, the value of these books is not about the concepts they cover, but how they illustrate each idea through examples that speak to each one of us.

So which one is the best?
