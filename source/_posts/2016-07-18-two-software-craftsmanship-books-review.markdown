Today I am gonna give you a quick review of the last two books I read: [The Clean Coder][clean-coder], by _Robert C. Martin_ (aka _Uncle Bob_), and [The Software Craftsman][software-craftsman], by _Sandro Mancuso_.
Both books cover the same topic: the **Software Craftsmanship** movement.

The Software What ?
-------------------

Remember my [first blog post about passion][first-blog-post] ? Well, if I had to rewrite it today I would title it "Be passionate, be a Software Craftsman".

Yes, Software Craftsmanship is all about passion. But it is also much more than that, and taught me a lot about my own weaknesses.

### Passion

I'm gonna be lazy and shamelessly quote Sandro's book:

{% blockquote Sandro Mancuso, The Software Craftsman %}
Passion. That summarizes it all. Software craftsmen are passionate about software development and their profession. They are passionate about solving problems with simple solutions. They are passionate about learning, teaching and sharing. Software craftsmen are passionate about helping the software industry to evolve; sharing their code; mentoring young developers; sharing their experiences via blogs, books, talks, videos, and conversations; and being active in technical communities.
{% endblockquote %}

Yes, I know, he just expressed above the exact content of my first blog post, but in a clearer and more efficient way... thank you for pointing that out! But even if I cannot compete with Sandro's writing style, at least we are on the same page regarding the importance of passion!

### Professionalism

But Software Craftsmanship is also about _professionalism_, as clearly demonstrated by the subtitle of the first book _"A Code of Conduct for Professional Programmers"_, and of the second one _"Professionalism, Pragmatism, Pride"_. If the message was not clear enough, you will find a reference to professionalism in every paragraph, if not sentence.

And this is where my previous vision fell short, and the first big lesson I learnt. Before reading these books, I figured the business world and true passion as natural opposites. I suggested to embrace your hobby and to not care about this corporate guys in suits that would crash your dream trying to make you do "just a job". In a word: I was childish.
I was thinking that success will come if you were motivated enough, and that only startup companies promoting cool-t-shirt-dress-code had understood the future of our industry. I was blaming everyone except me for things that may not go well in failing projects, companies or culture environment. I was acting as the opposite of a Software Craftsman, as this movement is all about taking responsibility, involvement in the project and in the company you are working for, and spreading the culture of passion with new technical disciplines.

### Disciplines and Values

Speaking about disciplines: you may expect this book to teach you a set of disciplines to apply in order to succeed in any situation. And even if it does mention a set of practices (like _Test Driven Development_, _Pair programming_ or _SOLID principles_), these books are **not** about these disciplines. These books are about **values**. It's a long term vision about our industry, the mistakes made, and how some current disciplines and attitudes can solve these common issues. It is not about the implementation of these disciplines. It is also not about having a fanboy attitude for such technology or methodology, but only for the value they bring. Software Craftsmen are not interested in these sterile and endless debates about who is coding on the coolest technologies. I know, what a bunch of killjoys...

### And many other things

I won't summarize here the content of the books. Many resources about Software Craftsmanship are already available online. If you are interested, you can watch one of the public presentations the authors gave (for instance [here][sandro-talk] and [there][uncle-bob-talk]) covering in some ways the same topic as the books. The value of these books is not so much about the topic they cover but how they illustrate each idea through different examples that speak to each one of us.

Why are these books so important?
---------------------------------

I hear you dear reader: do you need to go through the hundreds of pages of these books to state such an obvious message as "be passionate and professional" ?
I wish my answer was no. I wish the values expressed in these books were so obvious that the whole Software Craftsmanship movement could be laugh at.
But the reality is different. And I'm sure you can see it.

### Simple facts

Have you ever been slow down in your projects by software evolutions that were waiting to be delivered? Have you ever been appalled by the numbers of regression encountered on releases that should not affect the failing features?
And as a developer, have you never feel mistrust for a business industry that does not understood you? Have you ever thought that if you were in charge, things would be better?

Chances are that the answer is yes. The sickness of the software industry cannot be more visible and truth is our society has no idea on how to recover from it. That's the intention of the Software Craftsmanship to provide a way out.

### Connecting both worlds

//TODO


Food for the mind
-----------------

Whatever book you read from the above, they will certainly achieve the same result: open new perspectives, provide a big shot of motivation and reconcile yourself with many situations you would have defined as problematic before.

During your reading, you will learn on how to raise yourself to the level of software craftsman without sacrificing your ethic and your personal life. 
But these books may also leave you with a strange feeling. They may open doors without you noticing. By questioning your work life you will also challenge your definition of happiness, your goals in life and maybe even rediscover your own identity ... It is of course not the purpose of Software Craftsmanship books to answer such philosophical questions, but be prepared to face them.
